<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mihaicerchez/MacBook-Brightness-Fix/releases/tag/v1.2">Here</a></p>

<p>My issue started when I replaced the whole upper lid of my Retina MacBook Pro Mid 2014.
I noticed that I couldn’t change the brightness of my screen, so I did a long research seeking for an answer.</p>

<p>I’ve made a program that’s compatible with all the versions of macOS.
Basically what it does is resetting your screen completely.</p>

<p>Just open it, and it will do it’s thing.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that it will turn off and back on.
After that, your screen brightness should change properly when you adjust it.</p>

<p>This fix in order to work, it should be opened at every boot. So put it in the login items in your macOS “User” settings.</p>
